    ## Overview
    Use this API to access a reduced dataset of health and social care organisations in England and Wales, such as trusts or GP practices, using the [Organisation Data Service (ODS)](https://cms.digital.nhs.uk/site/_cmsinternal/developer/api-catalogue/organisation-data-service-ord). This FHIR API contains a reduced dataset, most useful for transactions. To access the full ODS dataset, including data about succession (history) or relationships, use the [ODS ORD API](http://https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/organisation-data-service-ord).
    
    You can search for information about an organisation using one or more of their:
    - ODS code
    - last updated date
    - name
    - active or inactive status
    - postcode or city
    - orgnisation's role or primary role, such as [trusts or GP practices](http://https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/restfulapis_identification_organization.html#tokenods-org-role)
    
    You can also limit the number of results returned, or just request a count of the number of search results.
    
    You cannot:
    - access the full dataset from ODS, specifically no information about succession (history) or relationships
    - search for an organisation using an address
    
    An ODS code is a unique identification code for an organisation that interacts with any area of the NHS. 
    This API returns the following reduced dataset of an organisation, when searched with an ODS code:
    
    - organisation - ODS code, name, open date, close date, last change date and status if active or inactive
    - address - house or flat number, line 1, line 2, line 3, town, postcode and country
    - contacts - email, website, telephone and fax
    - roles - primary and non-primary roles
   
    For more details, see the [Introduction to FHIRÂ® ODS Lookup API](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ods/index.html).
    To access the full ODS dataset, use the [ODS ORD API](https://https://cms.digital.nhs.uk/site/_cmsinternal/developer/api-catalogue/organisation-data-service-ord).

    ## Who can use this API
    This API can only be used to support the delivery of health and social care.
    
    ## Related APIs
    The following API also gives access to the Organisation Data Service:
    - [ODS Organisation Reference Data (ORD) API](https://https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/organisation-data-service-ord) - use this API to access the full ODS dataset
    
    The following API is also related to this API:
    - [Spine Directory Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/spine-directory-service-fhir) - use this API to access ASID information and messaging endpoint details in the Spine Directory Service (SDS).
    
    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is [in production](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=allexceptdone&tag=ods-api#controls).
    If you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    
    ## Service level
    This API is a bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.
    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).
    
    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).
    
    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir)global standard for health care data exchange. Specifically, it is based on the HL7 FHIR STU3 Messaging Implementation.
    
    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised, singular and in American English, for example`/Organization` not `/organisations`
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object
    
    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.
    
    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).
    
    ## Security and authorisation
    This API is [open-access](https://https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#open-access-apis), which means:
    - we do not authenticate or authorise the calling application
    - we do not authenticate or authorise the end user - they might not even be present
    
    We generally use open-access APIs for public data, where security is not a concern. Our open-access APIs are generally RESTful APIs. For more details on how to access them, see our [open-access REST API tutorial](https://https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/tutorials/open-access-rest-api-tutorial).
    
    ## Environments and testing
    
    | Environments                | Base URLs                                                              |
    | -----------------           | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | User acceptance test (UAT)  |`https://uat.directory.spineservices.nhs.uk/STU3/`                      |
    | Production                  |`https://directory.spineservices.nhs.uk/STU3/`                          |
    
    For example:
    'https://uat.directory.spineservices.nhs.uk/STU3/Organization/RJY'
    returns the reduced dataset for the organisation whose ODS code is RJY.
    
    ## Onboarding
    This API is open-access, and there is no onboarding process or assurance required.
    
    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:
    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
